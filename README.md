# Whatify
## Inspiration
The inspiration behind Whatify is to address the issue of hate speech and negative comments on social media in India. With the increasing number of social media users in India, it's important to create awareness among people about the impact of their negative comments on the victims. Whatify aims to dynamically analyze the sentiment of the text and display it to the user.

## What it does
Whatify is a social media platform that analyzes the sentiment of the text and displays it to the user. The user interface consists of a sentiment button, send button, and reset button. The sentiment button analyzes the text and provides a sentiment score, while the send button sends the text after analyzing the sentiment. The reset button is used to reset the score.


## How we built it
Whatify was built using various technologies such as Python, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and GUI toolkit - tkinter. The sentiment analysis model was built using NLP libraries such as NLTK and TextBlob. The user interface was developed using tkinter, which is a standard GUI toolkit for Python.

## Challenges we ran into
One of the main challenges we faced was building an accurate sentiment analysis model. We had to train the model on a large dataset of text samples to improve its accuracy. Another challenge was building a user-friendly interface that would be easy to use for all types of users.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of developing a platform that can potentially reduce hate speech and negative comments on social media. Our sentiment analysis model has shown to be accurate in analyzing text and providing sentiment scores. We are also proud of the user interface, which is intuitive and user-friendly.

## What we learned
We learned a lot about NLP and how it can be used to build a sentiment analysis model. We also learned about tkinter and HTML/CSS, which helped us develop a user-friendly interface. Additionally, we learned about the importance of creating awareness about the impact of negative comments on social media.

## What's next for Whatify 
In the future, we plan to improve the accuracy of our sentiment analysis model and expand the platform to include more features such as image and video analysis. We also plan to integrate Whatify with existing social media platforms to increase its reach and impact. Finally, we want to create more awareness about the impact of hate speech and negative comments on social media.
